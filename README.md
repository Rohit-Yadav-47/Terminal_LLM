### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rohit-Yadav-47/Terminal_LLM.git
   cd Terminal_LLM
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**

   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```

## Configuration

1. **Obtain Groq API Key**

   - Sign up or log in to your [Groq account](https://groq.com/).
   - Navigate to the API section to generate your API key.

2. **Set Up API Key**

   - Open `terminal.py` in a text editor.
   - Locate the following line:

     ```python
     self.api_key = "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"  # Replace with your GROQ API key
     ```

   - Replace the placeholder API key with your actual Groq API key:

     ```python
     self.api_key = "your_actual_groq_api_key_here"
     ```

   - **Security Tip**: For enhanced security, consider using environment variables or a configuration file to store your API key instead of hardcoding it.
